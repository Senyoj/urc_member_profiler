### URC Member Profile Portal
## Project Overview
The URC Member Profile Portal is a web application designed for the Robotics Club members to easily find and connect with each other. This portal serves as a platform for club members to showcase their skills, create profiles, and collaborate on various projects within the club. With the ability to search for other members by name or skill set, it enhances networking and knowledge sharing among club members.

## Features
# User Registration and Profile Creation
Members can sign up by providing their details, including name, contact information, and a brief bio.
They have the option to add their skill sets, which will be displayed on their profiles.
Profile creation allows members to showcase their expertise and interests within the club.

# Member Search
Once signed in, club members can search for other members using two primary methods:
1. Search by Name: Members can search for their peers by entering their names.
2. Search by Skill: Members can search for other club members based on specific skills or areas of expertise.

# Skill-Based Results
When searching by skill, the portal provides a list of club members who possess the desired skill sets.
For instance, if a member searches for "Mobile App Development," the portal will display a list of club members with Mobile App Development skills.
# Contact and Connect
Members have the option to connect or contact other members for collaboration, assistance, or networking.
This feature fosters a sense of community and encourages knowledge sharing and cooperation among club members.
## Project Illustration
Imagine a scenario where a club member is interested in finding individuals with expertise in "Mobile App Development." Here's how the URC Member Profile Portal facilitates this:

# Member Registration
 The member signs up with their name, contact information, and skills, including "Mobile App Development."

# Search for Mobile App Development Experts
 After logging in, the member navigates to the search feature and enters "Mobile App Development" as a skill.

# Skill-Based Search Results
 The portal returns a list of club members who have "Mobile App Development" listed in their skill sets.

Connect and Collaborate: The member can now click on the profiles of these experts, view their details, and initiate contact or collaboration.
